Project Title:
---------------
Regression Test Suite for the Kraken WebSocket API

Project Motivation:
--------------------
The project has been created as part of the assessment process applying to the job posting of "Trading Technology SDET Assessment" at Kraken.

Language: Python
Test Framework: Pytest


Project Implementation:
------------------------
The main requirement of this project is to build a Regression Test Suite to test the Kraken WebSocket API. However, to do so
several modules had to be created first in order to build a scalable and reusable code.

The class KrakenWebSocket is created to:
 Filename: kraken_websocket.py
 - Create and connect to a websocket
 - To send and receive messages through the websocket
   - Note, multi-threading was applied to continuously receive any incoming messages on the connected websocket
 - To decode and store messages in their corresponding feed queues, based on the channelName and pair

The classes PublicMessages and GeneralMessages (among others) provide access to modules for performing actions on the feed message (object).
  Filename: messages/ks_messages.py
 - Extract information, e.g. ChannelID, ChannelName, Payload, Pair, etc.
 - Retrieve the data structure of a message to access the desired fields within the message
 - Validate the received feed message/s against their corresponding JSON schemas
 - Validate the SubscriptionStatus message contents

The JSON schemas were created and are used to validate the received feed messages:
  Filename: messages/schemas.py
  - File used to test feed message against pre-defined schemas.
    - This component is vital to ensure message contents and data structures are in the expected order per the API documentation.
    - Potential code refactoring may introduce changes in the API message stream, the JSON schemas will ensure the structure is consistent and will flag any violations.


Regression Test Cases:
-----------------------
A total of 14 test cases have been devised to run and test the Kraken WebSocket API, in this section, each test scenario and validation criteria are specified illustrating the
approach and methodology.

The test cases cover functional and performance related validation and testing. Note that stress testing was not performed since one of the assignment requirements is not to send large number of requests, nor large number of connection requests, etc.

  Filename: test_ks_websocket.py

    Test Case#1: test_subscribe_to_public_channel
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to all public channels, including, 'ohlc', 'book', 'trade', 'ticker', 'spread'

        Validation Criteria:
        - The received SubscriptionStatus message should indicate successful subscription and is validated field by field
        - The time between sending a subscribe message to receiving a SubscriptionStatus message is expected to be
        less than 5 seconds on the socket

        Test Category:
        - Functional and Performance testing

    Test Case#2: test_subscribe_to_incorrect_channel
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to an invalid channel name, i.e. 'fake'

        Validation Criteria:
        - The received SubscriptionStatus message should indicate unsuccessful subscription and is validated field by field
        - The time between sending a subscribe message to receiving a SubscriptionStatus message is expected to be
        less than 5 seconds on the socket

        Test Category:
        - Functional and Performance testing

    Test Case#3: test_subscribe_with_incorrect_field
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to a public channel, adding the optional field 'Interval'.
        This field is only applicable to the 'ohlc' channel.

        Validation Criteria:
        if channel == ohlc:
            - The received SubscriptionStatus message should indicate successful subscription
        else:
            - The received SubscriptionStatus message should indicate successful subscription

        Test Category:
        - Functional and Performance testing

    Test Case#4: test_subscribe_with_wrong_pair_field
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to each public channel with wrong input on pair field. The WebSocket API expects a list
        to be provided. Instead, a string will be provided.
        This is expected to trigger an error on the subscription status message

        Validation Criteria:
        - The received SubscriptionStatus message should indicate unsuccessful subscription and is validated field by field
        - The time between sending a subscribe message to receiving a SubscriptionStatus message is expected to be
        less than 5 seconds on the socket

        Test Category:
        - Functional and Performance testing

    Test Case#5: test_subscribe_to_public_channel_multi_pairs
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to all available public channels, including, 'ohlc', 'book', 'trade', 'ticker', 'spread'
        with multiple pairs, e.g. XBT/USD and ETH/EUR

        Validation Criteria:
        - A SubscriptionStatus message is expected to be received for each of the pairs
        - Validate the contents of the SubscriptionStatus message

        Test Category:
        - Functional testing

    Test Case#6: test_subscribe_to_public_channel_incorrect_pair
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to all available public channels, including, 'ohlc', 'book', 'trade', 'ticker', 'spread'
        with an incorrect pair, e.g. MAG/USD

        Validation Criteria:
        - A SubscriptionStatus message will indicate an error "Currency pair not supported MAG/USD"
        - Validate the contents of the SubscriptionStatus message

        Test Category:
        - Functional testing

    Test Case#7: test_subscribe_to_public_channel_multi_pair_incorrect_and_correct
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to all available public channels, including, 'ohlc', 'book', 'trade', 'ticker', 'spread'
        with an array of pairs that include a supported and another unsupported pair, e.g. MAG/USD and XBT/USD

        Validation Criteria:
        - Expected to receive two SubscriptionStatus messages
        - 1st SubscriptionStatus message will indicate an error "Currency pair not supported MAG/USD" for MAG/USD pair
        - 2nd SubscriptionStatus message will indicate successful subscription to the supported pair XBT/USD
        - Validate the contents of the SubscriptionStatus messages

        Test Category:
        - Functional testing

    Test Case#8: test_unsubscribe_to_public_channel
        Test Scenario:
        Send a subscribe message to the 'book' public channel
        Wait for incoming feed within 20seconds or until we reach 20 messages are available in the feed queue
        Send unsubscribe message for the same channel

        Validation criteria:
        - Validate the contents of the unsubscribe message
        - Validate that the feed stops/halts after unsubscribing to a given channel, i.e. feed queue should not increase

        Test Category:
        - Functional testing

    Test Case#9: test_increasing_epoch_on_spread_feed
        Test Scenario:
        Subscribe to the spread channel and compare the epoch on incoming feeds.
        Wait for at least a number of messages are available in the feed queue

        Validation Criteria:
        - Check if SubscriptionStatus and Spread feed messages are seen on the socket/channel
        - Check if epoch on subsequent messages in the 'spread' feed queue are an increasing order

        Test Category:
        - Functional testing

        *Note: In few occasions this test case would fail due to epoch on latest arriving message in the spread feed queue being less than the previous message in the queue. The following is a snapshot highlighting such incident.
